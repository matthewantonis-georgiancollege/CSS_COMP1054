            Greetings to all who read this! My name is Matthew Antonis, born on October 21, 1999, making me 23-years-old.
            Computers have always captivated me, and my true passion lies in programming. It is my fervent desire to work 
            and reside in Japan, immersing myself in its vibrant technological landscape. Presently, I am enrolled in the 
            CMPG program, with the ultimate objective of successfully completing it and transferring to Lakehead University 
            to pursue a degree in computer science.
        </p>
