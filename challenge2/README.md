# CSS Challenge Two
 
## To Complete This Assignment: 

1.) Return to your code from Challenge One (Part One). Fix any errors/formatting issues in your CSS. 

2.) Add a new background image or gradient to some element in your web page to enhance the page and not detract from the readability of content. For royalty-free images, check out unsplash.com or pexels.com. Ensure images will not impact your webpage performance. 

3.) Using the filter function, manipulate the image that originally appeared in your challenge, and apply at least two different effects. 

4.) Make the image from challenge one responsive using a strategy shown in class or another strategy found online. 

5.) Set the width of the div.wrapper to 80% of the viewport width using an appropriate measurement. Add a background colour and border to div.wrapper. If you need colour palette inspiration, check out [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) 

6.) Set the header to 90% of div.wrapper and centre it within the .wrapper div. Add a background colour using an appropriate colour unit.
